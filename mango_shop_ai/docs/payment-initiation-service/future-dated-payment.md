## Future dated payment

Payment Initiation Service offers initiation of a future dated payment request. Future payments are always registered for a future payment date.

Future dated payment is set through credit transfers endpoints (see more details in [payment flow][post-payment-section]) by adding optional execution date parameter which specifies when payment should be executed.

>Execution date cannot be past and is max 1 year in the future.

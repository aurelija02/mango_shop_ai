### Duplicate payment

In Sweden two payments are considered to be duplicates when all of the following fields contain identical information: type of payment(BG/PG), date, amount, debit account, credit account(BG/PG number), remittance information (OCR number/unstructured text). This will lead to a Logical Duplicate error and payment will be rejected.
